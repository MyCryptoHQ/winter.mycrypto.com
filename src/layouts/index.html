For example, if a flashlight app is requesting access to your phone contacts... you should think twice.<br /><br />Be EXTRA careful when something is requesting read AND write access to your Twitter.<br /><br />Read access means that it can see things like your Twitter feed and see the tweets you’ve posted, but write access means that the service can post and delete tweets from your account for you. Double, triple, and quadruple check that this is a service you *really* need before you allow these permissions.</p>",
